  # Project Description
  This project uses a node CLI to compile employee indentification cards with dynamic HTML
  # Installation
  The User must install all dependancies before running the application.
  # Usage
  The user inputs information into the CLI which produces a team.html file located in the output folder.
  # Tests
  This project was very difficult to complete, I had trouble originally with combining the constructors with my app.js file.  I used the tutoring service provided through thr program and was able to get some input on what I was missing.  Mostly that I had not used the templates and provided DEV files.  Once I got those integrated things became alot easier.
